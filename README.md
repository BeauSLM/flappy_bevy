# Flappy Bevy

## About

A WIP implementation of the game Flappy Bird, using the bevy game engine. Written
to familiarize myself with both the Rust Programming Language and the Bevy game
engine.

## Note on Assets

I'm using assets from another repo, linked as a submodule to the assets folder.
Take a look if you're looking to implement this game yourself. Please note that
I did NOT make these assets, I simply used assets provided by another individual
(much thanks if you're reading btw, they're clutch af).
